# Reducing-Hospital-Readmissions
Our goal is to assess whether initial diagnoses, the number of procedures, or other variables could provide insight into the probability of readmission, and to identify those patients who are at a higher risk of readmission so that the hospital can focus their follow-up calls and attention accordingly.
